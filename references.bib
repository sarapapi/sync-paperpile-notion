                   pre-trained big models are proposed, such as BERT, ViT, GPT,

                   domains (like computer vision and natural language
                   processing), the multi-modal pre-trained big models have
                   also drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this
                   work, we give a comprehensive survey of these models and
                   hope this paper could provide new insights and helps fresh
                   researchers to track the most cutting-edge works.
                   Specifically, we firstly introduce the background of
                   multi-modal pre-training by reviewing the conventional deep
                   learning, pre-training works in natural language process,
                   computer vision, and speech. Then, we introduce the task
                   definition, key challenges, and advantages of multi-modal
                   pre-training models (MM-PTMs), and discuss the MM-PTMs with
                   a focus on data, objectives, network architectures, and
                   knowledge enhanced pre-training. After that, we introduce
                   the downstream tasks used for the validation of large-scale
                   MM-PTMs, including generative, classification, and
                   regression tasks. We also give visualization and analysis of
                   the model parameters and results on representative
                   downstream tasks. Finally, we point out possible research
                   directions for this topic that may benefit future works. In
                   addition, we maintain a continuously updated paper list for

                   complex audio information and solve numerous understanding

                   manifold lying in a high-dimensional space into latent
                   representations. Ideally, the distribution of the data
                   points in the latent space should depend only on the task,
                   the data, the loss, and other architecture-specific
                   constraints. However, factors such as the random weights
                   initialization, training hyperparameters, or other sources
                   of randomness in the training phase may induce incoherent
                   latent spaces that hinder any form of reuse. Nevertheless,
                   we empirically observe that, under the same data and
                   modeling choices, the angles between the encodings within
                   distinct latent spaces do not change. In this work, we
                   propose the latent similarity between each sample and a
                   fixed set of anchors as an alternative data representation,
