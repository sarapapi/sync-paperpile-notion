  abstract      = "Speech language models (SpeechLMs) process and generate
                   acoustic data only, without textual supervision. In this
                   work, we propose TWIST, a method for training SpeechLMs
                   using a warm-start from a pretrained textual language
                   models. We show using both automatic and human evaluations
                   that TWIST outperforms a cold-start SpeechLM across the
                   board. We empirically analyze the effect of different model
                   design choices such as the speech tokenizer, the pretrained
                   textual model, and the dataset size. We find that model and
                   dataset scale both play an important role in constructing
                   better-performing SpeechLMs. Based on our observations, we
                   present the largest (to the best of our knowledge) SpeechLM
                   both in terms of number of parameters and training data. We
                   additionally introduce two spoken versions of the StoryCloze
                   textual benchmark to further improve model evaluation and
                   advance future research in the field. We make speech
                   samples, code and models publicly available:
